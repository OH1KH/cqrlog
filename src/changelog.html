    <li>Preferences:Xplanet:Fix: Layout should now be similar with GTK2 and QT5</li>
    <li>UTF8: Procedure that prevents writing UTF8 chars to columns that do not provide _INTL suffixed ADIF tag</li>
    <li>UTF8: Try to make NewQSO more UTF8 compatible in cases where UTF8 chars appear to columns that
    <br>should contain only ASCII 7bit by ADIF standard. That may happen with callbook data added.
    <br>Faulty entry is saved to log, but will not export to ADIF. As well as ADIF import will ignore
    <br>nonstandard tags.</li>
    <li>Wsjt:Cq-monitor:Add: checkbox DX includes now popup to select shown Dx continents</li>
    <li>Xplanet:Fix:If Show own pos show also opponents, and even when None-source is selected</li>

        of then way TRX,CW and Modes are handled. Removed flushing.
        Missing commas added to Configuration Storage Settings/Save. (Tnx: Luca,IK5PWC) </li>
    <li>Preferences:Configuration Storage Settings: Closing with 'save' flushes Xlocal.cfg<br>
        After that is done preferences MUST be closed with 'OK' to rewrite Xlocal.cfg<br>
        'Cancel' is that's why disabled then.</li>
    <li>Contest: Common Status display improvements. Band grid. Current band gets yellow background. </li>

    </ul><li>(117)</li><ul>
    <li>Preferences:TRXControl: Added checkbox 'compound poll' (default checked) When unchecked rig polling commands are sent each one on it's own line. This may help poor emulators like WFview.</li>
    <li>HamlibCW: Fixed StopSending procedure. Has now '+\stop_morse currVFO' that should work also other rigs than ts480 and Icoms and is implemented in rigctld at least from Jan2023</li> 
    <li>Callbook: CQRZCQ XML fixd and tested. Should be mostly ok now.</li>
    <li>Callbook: Added support to QRZCQ, not tested at all yet because of lack of premium account</li>

    <li>Contest: pressing 'CQ start' moves focus to Call column</li>
    <li>Added hint texts to first start DB selection window</li>
    <li>Cabrillo export: Changed export to use time_off instead of time_on. 
    <br>With CW and Phone qsos this does not matter as times are usually same.
    <br>With FT8 qso takes longer and WSTX's (and N1MM's) exports are using time_off.
    <br>Now Cqrlog's export is equal to others.</li>
    </ul><li>(116)</li><ul>

    HamQTH/QRZ info is now looked when Wsjtx/DXCall changes on RX and TX period<br>
    (Was before only on TX period)</li>
    <li>Contest window:<br>

    </ul><li>(109)</li><ul>
    <li>Fixed numkeypad in contest/callsign/gtk2, QT5 was already working</li>
    <li>RBNmonitor: Added source callsign filter</li>
    <li>Removed small change to "remove all upload triggers". No good<br>
	Instead added warnings for use with more than on online log</li>
    </ul><li>(108)</li><ul>
    <li>Very small change to "remove all upload triggers". Helps? </li>

    </ul><li>(107)</li><ul>
    <li>Added cache write while preferences closing. Speeds up %50</li>

    <li>Fixed some rig and rot parameter readings</li>
    <li>Fixed ver(104) bug where rig did not initialize if TRXControl window
        <br> stayed closed during Cqrlog start</li>
    </ul><li>(105)</li><ul>
    <li>Added macros:
	<br>%xnr - contest exchange serial number received
	<br>%xnrs- contest exchenge serial number received sends 9->N and 0->T
	<br>%xmr - contest exchange message received</li>
    <li>Fixed offline qso feed. When qso is saved returns to QsoDate column.
	<br>This makes qso manual feed from paper log easier as things start
	<br>from date and tabulation continues in chronological order:
	<br>date,start,end,call,freq, mode .. etc and when qso is saved
	<br>focus returns again to date column.    
	<br>When typing in Date and times in Offline Cqrlog will add punctuation
	<br>marks ('-' or ':') automatic. This way only number keys need to be typed.    
	<br>When not valid locator is entered (usually odd number of characters)
	<br>NewQSO/GRID label will turn bold red as warning sign when exit from
	<br>grid column.</li>
    <li>Added support for 1-6 rigs. User can define how many rigs he want to use
	<br>As before, only one rig can be active at time.
	<br>This change affects also mode/bandwidths settings and CW keyer settings.
	<br>All rigs can have their own settings for BW and CW keyer.</li>
    <li>Fix for quick split settings.
	<br>Fixed all edtboxes value limits to 0..9999. Fixed tabulation orders</li>
    <li>Added serial CW keyer commanding menu item.
	<br>Menuitem: NewQSO/File/Send hex bytes to keyer (W or K)
	<br>Item is visible with winkeyer or K3NG keyer and allows non text
	<br>hex bytes to be sent to serial line. </li>
    <li>Fix for contest name in contests that have all modes in use
	<br>CW/SSB/FM/MGM like NAC has.
	<br>Then MGM qsos coming from WSJT-X will get name from Cqrlog contest
	<br>name currently in contest window if it is open during remote.
	<br>This overwrites WSJT-X predefined 4 contest names making all
	<br>qsos in contest to have same contest name defined in contest window. </li>
    <li>Upgrade to Contest window
	<br>-Has now checkbox "S&P". When checked works as before.
	<br> When not checked launches memories F2,F3,F4 automated when
	<br> moving on columns.
	<br> F1 for sending CQ. Can be auto-repeated
	<br> F2 for sending call, rst and message
	<br> F3 for sending duplicate qso warning
	<br> F4 for sending after qso is logged with button or enter key
	<br>-Has now hint texts added. They can be turned off with checkbox.
	<br>-Has now status display to see how contest progress.
	<br>  procedure MWC will show OK1WC memorial status
	<br>  procedure NAC will show Nordic VUSHf activiy contest status
	<br>  Common status will show status of other (unspecified) contest statuses
	<br>  with user defined view.
	<br> More status procedures can be added later.
	<br>-Duplicate check will work now while typing in callsign. (before worked
	<br>     after cursor left callsign column)
	<br>-Added "Mark Dupe" checbox. When checked with duplicate check ON
	<br> saved dupicate qso is marked to "RST send" with "/D". It is operator's
	<br> duty to do something (or not) with this after Cabrillo log is produced.
	<br>
	<br>For more specific information see revised contest help file, please!</li>
    <li>Misc bug fixes.
	<br>-Changed Contest Filter to show contest names in order from A to Z (acs)
	<br>-Adjusted Contest Filter maxlines to default (8). This has effect when
	<br> QT5 widgets are used (shows more contest names at time).
	<br>-Fixed typo in Group edit field selector. Had "Å" in "operator"
	<br>-Fixed TRXControl's button "70cm". If no previous settings for 70cm
	<br> defaults were done loaded 80m band settings when pressed.
	<br>-Fixed double usage of query qBands. Preferences/bands/Frequencies list
	<br>loose it's grid contents if Wsjt-x remote is on (behind) and CQ-monitor selected.
	<br>-Updated help files</li>
        <li>WSJT-C CQ monitor shows US states
	<br>CQ-monitor checbox "USt" that allows USA states to monitored wsjt-CQs
	<br>When you check it at first time it suggests loading from fcc.gov it should
	<br>suggest same after 90 days of usage to update data.
	<br>US callsign=state (fcc_states.tab) file is over 10Mb and ist is loaded 
	<br>to RAM for runtime. Seeking a callsingn from there takes some time.</li>
    <li>RTTY mode is now DATA
	<br>At preferences/Modes you will see a new "DATA" that replaces the old "RTTY". 
	<br>Defaults for that are rig cmd:RTTY data mode:RTTY that acts like previous Cqrlogs.
	<br>Setting data mode affects DXSpots coloring and double clicking: You can set other
	<br>mode than RTTY to be used. </li>
    <li>Online log upload
	<br>Bottom of Preferences/Online log upload has some checkboxes to affect 
	<br>to online log upload. 
	<br>See help/Quick start/Online log upload support for more information. </li>
