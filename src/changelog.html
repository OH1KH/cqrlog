    <strong>Alpha test version of CQRLOG 2.6.0 (104)</strong><br>
    New in this alpha version (not yet in official version):<br>
    <ul style="list-style: square;text-align:left; color: red;">
    <li>Fixed offline qso feed. When qso is saved returns to QsoDate column.
	<br>This makes qso manual feed from paper log easier as things start
	<br>from date and tabulation continues in chronological order:
	<br>date,start,end,call,freq, mode .. etc and when qso is saved
	<br>focus returns again to date column.    
	<br>When typing in Date and times in Offline Cqrlog will add punctuation
	<br>marks ('-' or ':') automatic. This way only number keys need to be typed.    
	<br>When not valid locator is entered (usually odd number of characters)
	<br>NewQSO/GRID label will turn bold red as warning sign when exit from
	<br>grid column.</li>
    <li>Added support for 1-6 rigs. User can define how many rigs he want to use
	<br>As before, only one rig can be active at time.
	<br>This change affects also mode/bandwidths settings and CW keyer settings.
	<br>All rigs can have their own settings for BW and CW keyer.</li>
    <li>Fix for quick split settings.
	<br>Fixed all edtboxes value limits to 0..9999. Fixed tabulation orders</li>
    <li>Added serial CW keyer commanding menu item.
	<br>Menuitem: NewQSO/File/Send hex bytes to keyer (W or K)
	<br>Item is visible with winkeyer or K3NG keyer and allows non text
	<br>hex bytes to be sent to serial line. </li>
    <li>Fix for contest name in contests that have all modes in use
	<br>CW/SSB/FM/MGM like NAC has.
	<br>Then MGM qsos coming from WSJT-X will get name from Cqrlog contest
	<br>name currently in contest window if it is open during remote.
	<br>This overwrites WSJT-X predefined 4 contest names making all
	<br>qsos in contest to have same contest name defined in contest window. </li>
    <li>Upgrade to Contest window
	<br>-Has now checkbox "S&P". When checked works as before.
	<br> When not checked launches memories F2,F3,F4 automated when
	<br> moving on columns.
	<br> F2 for sending call, rst and message
	<br> F3 for sending duplicate qso warning
	<br> F4 for sending after qso is logged with button or enter key
	<br>-Has now hint texts added. They can be turned off with checkbox.
	<br>-Has now status display to see how contest progress.
	<br>  procedure MWC will show OK1WC memorial status
	<br>  procedure NAC will show Nordic VUSHf activiy contest status
	<br>  Common status will show status of other (unspecified) contest statuses
	<br>  with user defined view.
	<br> More status procedures can be added later.
	<br>-Duplicate check will work now while typing in callsign. (before worked
	<br>     after cursor left callsign column)
	<br>-Added "Mark Dupe" checbox. When checked with duplicate check ON
	<br> saved dupicate qso is marked to "RST send" with "/D". It is operator's
	<br> duty to do something (or not) with this after Cabrillo log is produced.
	<br>
	<br>For more specific information see revised contest help file, please!</li>
    <li>Misc bug fixes.
	<br>-Changed Contest Filter to show contest names in order from A to Z (acs)
	<br>-Adjusted Contest Filter maxlines to default (8). This has effect when
	<br> QT5 widgets are used (shows more contest names at time).
	<br>-Fixed typo in Group edit field selector. Had "Å•" in "operator"
	<br>-Fixed TRXControl's button "70cm". If no previous settings for 70cm
	<br> defaults were done loaded 80m band settings when pressed.
	<br>-Fixed double usage of query qBands. Preferences/bands/Frequencies list
	<br>loose it's grid contents if Wsjt-x remote is on (behind) and CQ-monitor selected.
	<br>-Updated help files</li>
    </ul>
    In alpha test version (but not in official version):<br>
    <ul style="list-style: square;text-align:left; color: blue;">
    <li>WSJT-C CQ monitor shows US states
	<br>CQ-monitor checbox "USt" that allows USA states to monitored wsjt-CQs
	<br>When you check it at first time it suggests loading from fcc.gov it should
	<br>suggest same after 90 days of usage to update data.
	<br>US callsign=state (fcc_states.tab) file is over 10Mb and ist is loaded 
	<br>to RAM for runtime. Seeking a callsingn from there takes some time.</li>
    <li>RTTY mode is now DATA
	<br>At preferences/Modes you will see a new "DATA" that replaces the old "RTTY". 
	<br>Defaults for that are rig cmd:RTTY data mode:RTTY that acts like previous Cqrlogs.
	<br>Setting data mode affects DXSpots coloring and double clicking: You can set other
	<br>mode than RTTY to be used. </li>
    <li>Online log upload
	<br>Bottom of Preferences/Online log upload has some checkboxes to affect 
	<br>to online log upload. 
	<br>See help/Quick start/Online log upload support for more information. </li>
