### Install official Cqrlog (2.5.2 with MariaDB) to Ubuntu 22.04 and optionally upgrade it to latest CqrlogAlpha

"install_Ubuntu2204_cqrlog.zip" holds script "install_cqrlog.sh" that has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 in Oracle virtual machine.
Download, unzip and start it in command console to install Cqrlog (without loadng it from Ubuntu's faulty install packet). Istalling is tested several times to plain Ubuntu 22.04, but no quarantee is given.

While testing I note few odd things with Ubuntu:
- It can not show help file from local folder with firefox
- it can make local MariaDB user but can not transfer address, port, username and password to Cqrlog's open database dialog. You have to write them down and type by your self.
Both of these may happen if you update right away to CqrlogAlpha and choose to save your logs to local database server (the 2nd selection) and/or like to read help for it.

In any case Ubuntu can not wait long enough when Cqrlog is creating first log and will prompt you that cqrlog is not resoponding.
Press "wait" or do nothing if this happens while creating first log at beginning.
